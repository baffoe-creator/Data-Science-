=======================================
author: Kuuku Baffoe

OBJECTIVE: 
=========

.To identify some the leading causes of employee churn from 
 solicited feedback to enable HR develop long-term strategies to reduce it.


INSTALLATION
============
.In order for the code to operate properly, the following modules must be downloaded.
.Pandas: Pandas makes it straightforward to perform many of the time-consuming, repetitive operations involved with data processing
.matplotlib: Matplotlib is a data visualization and graphical charting package for Python and its numerical extension NumPy that is cross-platform. As such, it provides an open source alternative to MATLAB.
.seaborn: Seaborn is a Python module for creating statistical visuals.
.sklearn: It offers a set of fast tools for machine learning and statistical modeling, such as classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction, via a Python interface.

USAGE 
=====
Run code with csv file in python ide of choice.



OBSERVATIONS
============
.According to the scatter plot of satisfaction level to last evaluation, 
a higher percentage of those with higher scores in their last evaluations were the most satisfied, 
while a significant number of employees with low evaluations had lower satisfaction levels.
this might indicate a tensed / competitive environment.

.Those with four projects were the most happy, while those with more than four were less content.
This might suggest that some employees felt overworked.


RECOMMENDATIONs
===============
.introduction of team bonding activities like retreats etc to reduce tension

.A more equitable workload distribution across employees would boost employee satisfaction.



CONCLUSION
===========
Accuracy: 0.9715555555555555
Precision: 0.958252427184466
Recall: 0.9207089552238806

According to the various data visualized, the number of projects, average monthly hours,
and last evaluationsÂ were the key factors of satisfaction level, which in turn impacted staff attrition.
